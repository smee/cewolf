Cewolf uses Apache Maven 2 as the build system as of version 0.12.0. Maven 2 can be downloaded from http://maven.apache.org.

To build cewolf using M2 you must first load a couple of jars into your local repository. In the cewolf/repository folder, run "mvn install." This will load gnujaxp and jfreechart-demo into your repository. All the other dependant jars are automatically downloaded by M2 from ibiblio.

To build cewolf, run "mvn install" from the cewolf folder. This will build the jar and javadocs place them in /target. 

To build the zip file deployed on sourceforge, run "mvn assembly:assembly" from the cewolf folder. The zip will be placed in /target. This jar will contain all the dependant jars and the source.
