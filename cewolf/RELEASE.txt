Release Notes for Version 0.13.0
--------------------------------
-Jpeg image support added.
-Added new tag parameters to img and legend:
	-removeAfterRender will remove images from storage immediately. Defaults to False. NOTE: This 
	may cause problems if your users expect to copy or save the images from the browser as some
	browsers will put the url in the paste buffer and attempt to reload when pasted somewhere such 
	as MS Word.
	-forceSessionId will add jsessionid parameter to the image url. Defaults to True. This matches
	existing functionality but now allows the option to disable this for certain use cases.
-Supports JFC 1.0.0 Final
	JFC no longer supports the signals chart type. This has been commented out in cewolf for now
	because there is talk on the forum that it may come back.
-At release time, site is not fully updated. This will come in the near future as I move the site fully to Maven2.
	

Release Notes for Version 0.12.0
--------------------------------
-Supports JFC 1.0.0-RC1

Release Notes for Version 0.11.0 Alpha
--------------------------------
-Now supports JFC 1.0 Pre 2
-Fixed bugs:1165987,1165979,1165967
-There where significant changes to the JFC Api in this release. See www.jfree.org forums
 for specific information. Chances are very good that your chart processors WILL BREAK because of these
 changes. This is not because of Cewolf, but because the JFC APIs changed.

Release Notes for Version 0.10.3
--------------------------------
-Added optional config parameter for FileStorage: "FileStorage.deleteOnExit" 
	to get the saved files deleted at normal shutdown.
-Improved overlaidchart can contain any number of sub-charts
-Added ChartImageRenderListener event callback interface can be implemented by ChartPostProcessor
	to get called back after the image rendered. 
	Useful to acquire JFreeChart's ChartRenderingInfo object.
-Fixed [ 1158392 ] Configuration object causes NPE when servlet reloads
-Fixed chart-renderer factory problem; that if multiple charts of the same type appeared
	on the same page they shared the same renderer, therefore if a post-processor customized
	that renderer all charts were affected.
-Fixed that tooltips would not appear in firefox; when the jsp page in a subdir
	need to use /etc/overlib.js style path in config for this.
